# mailman

**Mailman** is a web application to which you can POST your code and receive a public IP address where it is already running.

### How does it work?

<p>All you have to worry about is your `index.html` file with your website.</p>

<p>In the `mailman` app you submit your `index.html` file, and we take care of the rest.</p>

<p>In a couple of minutes, the backend will be ready and you will receive a public IP address from which your website will be accessible.</p>

<p>You app will be live at the designated IP address for a predefined default period of 48hrs.</p>
