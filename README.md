# mailman

**Mailman** is a web application to which you can POST your code and receive a public IP address where it is already running.

### How does it work?

All you have to worry about is your `index.html` file with your website. In the `mailman` app you submit your `index.html` file, and we take care of the rest. In a couple of minutes, the backend will be ready and you will receive a public IP address from which your website will be accessible. You app will be live at the designated IP address for a predefined default period of 48hrs.

### Service-Level Agreement

This application and deployment are prpvided free of charge for both client and server sides.
At the same time, support is provided as-is.
